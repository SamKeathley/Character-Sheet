Character Sheet app (super creative name to come)

The goal:

-This app aims to replace your basic front page of a traditional character page. With this, you will be able to create your characters and save them to a campaign (or party). The overall goal of the app is to work in conjunction with your pen and paper adventure log, just eliminating all of the erasing and flipping through pages to, say, calculate damage.  

Future features:

-"Party mode," where the DM can view all of the campaign members sheets

-Spell/feature library

-Equipment management
